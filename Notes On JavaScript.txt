Variables can be used to store numbers that need to be updated.
Ex: Health Bars
var name = value;

Must put semi-colon after every line or get error: unexpected token

Quotes around text make the text a string

// to comment out the rest of a line

Booleans
var name = true/false
if name do stuff; //does nothing if name is false

To declare a variable with not value you can create it as undefined
var name;

Can create const values that can not be changed using
const name = value;
Helps with not reusing name of variable by accident
